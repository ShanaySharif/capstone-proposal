Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The purpose of this app is to enable users to order coffee, including cappuccinos, cold brews (iced/hot), and lattes, from the comfort of their homes. Users can sign up or log in to create a profile, where they can add their favorite caffeinated drinks to their cart


List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Full CRUD
* Signup/Login
*

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* Javascript and React
* Possibily C# as backend language


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Right now I want to focus on having full functionality for my capstone however, with time to spare, I'd love to have an amazing splash page and UI. 
* Not sure how this would love, but maybe the ability for users to leave comments/reviews about their order!
* And lastly user Auth.




What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?



Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
